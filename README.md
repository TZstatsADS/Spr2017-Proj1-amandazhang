![image](figs/title.jpg)

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Project title: How Inauguration Evolve Through Time?
+ This project is conducted by Qingyuan Zhang :point_right:([`amandazhang`](https://github.com/amandazhang))

+ Project summary: This project applies text mining and NLP skills such as 
topic modeling and word cloud onto 58 inauguration speeches, and has some
interesting finding on our 45th President Trump. The final report is under `doc` folder.
You can easily reproduce the report by cloning this repository onto your own
local machine and rerun `Report.rmd` in the `doc` folder, it should take you less than
5 minutes to generate the output. One remark is that two `ShinyApps` are embedded in the
code so you can play with the output yourself and get better understanding. Hope
you'll like it! :+1:
